<h3>This is the home page.</h3>

<p>This is the page that should be populated with a UI for users to
	manage their connected devices.</p>
<br />
<p>There should also be some kind of flag on the controller for this
	page that if the user has not registered the device they are prompted
	with a form to register the motherboard. Registering the mothership
	will also set the org_url and the secret_key. The flag on the
	controller can just be to check if the org_url and the secret_key is
	not blank in memory. If it is blank attempt to read the file with those
	values and if they are still blank then prompt the user for that info</p>
